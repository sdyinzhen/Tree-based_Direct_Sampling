# TDS: Tree-based Direct Sampling (on 2D Topography modeling)
<p> This is the first version of the Tree-based Direct Sampling (TDS), with 2D Antactica Topography modeling case as example. 

### Structure of the TDS setup
The TDS has two steps:
* Step 1: Training Phase, run under directory [TDS_TrainingPhase](https://github.com/sdyinzhen/Tree-based_Direct_Sampling/tree/master/TDS_TrainingPhase). This step build a tree using Training Image (TI)
* Step 2: Simulation Phase, run under [TDS_SimulationPhase2.0](https://github.com/sdyinzhen/Tree-based_Direct_Sampling/tree/master/TDS_SimulationPhase2.0). This step simulate direct sampling realizations using the tree built at Step 1. 
### Install and Run TDS
Please follow the provided [User Manual](https://github.com/sdyinzhen/Tree-based_Direct_Sampling/blob/master/UserManual_Tree-basedDirectSampling.pdf) to install and run TDS

To run the TDS, the following dependencies must be met:
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) 
* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/) 
* We recommend to install the above two together via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Eclipse IDE for Java](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
